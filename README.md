# Resume of topics/exercises/projects developed in this repo
These are some old works. The folder are:

1) **Arduino**: Actually Waspmote (very similar to arduino). Some scripts developed.

2) **AutonomoDrive**: *Code developed in Matlab*.Planification and reactive algorithms for moves robor controll

3) **SlopeSoftwareOptimized**: *Software wrote on Matlab*. It computes the FS of a soil slope.
   It uses three methods: a) Fellenius. b) Bishop c) Morgenstern Price. In order to implement 
   the Morgenstern-Price method a recent algorithm is used. The method is optimezed with an own 
   optimization algorithm.
   

4) **WorkPDF**: Some pdf works: a) age detection b) Advanced Algebra c) Marcov chains

5) **GravitationalAlgorithm**: *Code developed in Matlab*. Meta-heuristic algorithm based on the gravitational force
applied to optimize the search in a slope stability problem

6) **MonteCarlo-LowVoltage**: *Code developed in Matlab*. Using the monte-carlo method to search the maximum capacity
of a low voltage network to integrate small wind turbine

7) **ParallelComputing**: *Code developed in C*. Some strategies of computing paralelization.
   MPI and openMP.
   
8) **BayesianStatistics**: Some exercises about Bayesian Statistics. PDFs a OpenBug codes

9) **KNN_Study**: *Code developed in R*. A study about performande of KNN_study with differente parameters.

10) **TextMining**: *Code developed in Python*. Comparison of differente Machine learning algorithm for Text Mining.

11) **WekaJava**: *Code developed in JAVA*. Using the framework of WEKA from JAVA for a machine learning project.
